# custom_sony_ds4
Sub Project of Network/Remote Streaming. This Project is about Sony's 'in-specific' Dualshock 4 Controller (v1+2).

Since the goal of the main project is to stream data from a host with powerful resources to a client this sub project/module will adapt to that.


Specifications unclear!

Read and send raw data over network  
or  
Read and parse custom data over network (reduce traffic, smaller packets, faster, enhance?)  
Benefits?? Profit??? Data Loss?
